# Max Azarcon Professional Website

This repository contains the source for my personal website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

Install dependencies and build the site:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
```

The generated site will appear in the `_site` directory.
